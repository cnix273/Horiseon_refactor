# Horiseon_refactor

Horiseon is a marketing agency that offers online social solutions services. 

The existing Horiseon website was refactored to improve accessibility and optimize HTML and CSS code.

## Modified Features

**Added/Modified attributes for improved accessibility and optimization include:**
1. Use of a descriptive title element
1. Replacement of <div> elements with corresponding semantic elements
1. Use of descriptive alt attributes for each img element
1. Use of id attributes in the article elements to ensure functioning <nav> links
1. Removal of redundant class attributes in the article elements

The implemented changes serve to improve accessibility of the website when using video captions, screen readers, braille keyboards, and other assistive technologies. These modifications also consolidate and and streamline the HTML and CSS code, making it more efficient and improving readability.

**Motivations behind changes:**
1. Ensure that people with disabilities can access Horiseon's website
1. Improve positioning in search engines
1. Reduce or eliminate potential for litigation

Further accessibility improvements include enabling keyboard-only navigation.
